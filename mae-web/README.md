# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

I aim to implement the Hexagonal and EBI patterns.

Tools to add:
Sorbet and RBS: Type checking
Ruby LSP and Solargraph: Intellisense
Packwerk: Enforce boundaries in modules
Rubocop: Prevent modules from using Rails specific features.
