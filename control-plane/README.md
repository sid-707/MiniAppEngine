# ControlPlane

## Description
This is the control plane to manage apps in the PaaS. Eventually it will be replaced 
with Kubernetes. However, this would be a good place to learn about Elixir's features 
like fault-tolerance and concurrency.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `control_plane` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:control_plane, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/control_plane>.
